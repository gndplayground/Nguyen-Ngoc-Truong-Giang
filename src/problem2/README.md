## Development

### Local Node Enviroment

If you prefer to run the app in your Node local machine

```
npm i

```
npm run dev
```

Check [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Technology Highlight

### Tailwind CSS

Although I have the ability to work with `Pure CSS (BEM)`, `CSS Module`, and `CSS in JS`, I decided to use this for rapid development of MVP projects.

### React-query

For an application, form actions always come along with data. Using React-query can come in handy.

The developer tend to have to deal with state management (like `isLoading`, `isFailed`, `isSummiting`), caching, invalidate cache... `React-query` can lift up the burden for the developer.

## Code quality

- Ensured the code quality with `eslint`, `style-lint`
- Formated the code with `prettier`
